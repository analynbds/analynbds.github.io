    <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Flavored is a personalized recipe finding app that allows people to find recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. It was based on an idea after I had moved away from home and had to learn how to cook for myself and do the grocery shopping on my own, too.</p>

<!--BEGIN: CHALLENGE -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
    <h3>The Callenge</h3>
    <p>This project was done for a class called "Visual Design for Mobile Applications." We were tasked to create a prototype of a mobile app of our own idea and to provide deliverables ranging from user surveys, personas, wireframes, usability tests, and a prototype on Invision. The app is titled (for now), "Flavored."</p>
    <!--END: CHALLENGE--> 
    
    <!--BEGIN: RESEARCH -->
    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p>I conducted a really basic user questionnaire to figure out how people generally cook or prepare their meals and what kinds of challenges they face when they do cook and follow a recipe. Other questions included how aimed to figure out attuned they were with technology on a daily basis and the resources they use to find recipes. The goal for this exercise was to research if there was a need for this type of app, and if so, how could it help people. </p>
    <p>I discovered that a lot of people who already do follow recipes find their recipes online and via YouTube. And while they were generally satisfied with their current recipe-finding resources, the biggest qualm would be that sometimes the recipe doesn’t turn out the way planned—thus lessening the cooking experience. Respondents also thought it would be a good idea to include a feature where users could choose certain diet options, like vegan or vegetarian recipes. Interestingly, this discovery led me to think about adding a feature where users could filter out recipes for different meals. </p>

    <!--BEGIN: Market Analysis -->
    <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
    <p>During my competitive analysis research, I found a few websites that performed the same function as my app idea, but not in an native mobile app form. While I did do extensive research on those sites, I also focused my research on native mobile apps to evaluate what the experiences on that platform were striving to do.</p>
      <p>I also researched products by well-known internet companies like All Recipes or Food.com. Both apps are popular for finding and discovering recipes—but usually when users have a recipe in mind. The Food.com mobile app allows users to find recipes based on one main ingredient (like beef or chicken) or based on the type of dishes. All Recipes’ mobile app allows users to search by recipe name. They also have a cool function called “Dinner Spinner,” which prompts users to choose a dish type, one main ingredient, and a cook time then provides users a list of matching recipes. </p>
      <p>From here, I was able to a list of ideas on how my app could enter the food-recipe market. I thought an interesting feature that could give my app a unique twist and help my users tremendously was to create a feature that could allow users to substitute an ingredient they might need with another ingredient they had in their ingredient list. </p>

          <h3>User Personas and Scenarios</h3>
          <p>My initial target users were young adults, around 17-30 year olds. I created two user personas based on the responses of my user questionnaire and what I planned my target demographic to be: John, the “Cost-Conscious College Student” looking to save money on food by buying in bulk, and Jane “The Busy Working Millennial” who loves to cook but doesn’t always have time to go to the grocery store.</p>

          <p>After creating these personas to help me visualize my users, I got a better understanding of the direction for my app. These users generally don't mind cooking at home, but during these moments they are struggling with deciding what exactly to cook.</p>
          <p>Realizing this, I decided to emphasize that my app can minimize the struggle of deciding what to cook and get users closer to the actual cooking. To do this, I designed the experience so that the main legwork would be looking around your kitchen (or even thinking about what you have in your pantry or what you want to cook with) and inputting those items into a list. After doing this step, users would be able to explore different recipes and even filter recipes based on the number of ingredients and time to suit their needs for their cooking session.</p>

      <p>After my first round of usability testing, I thought I was set on fixing the problems that were brought up. However, at the end of this round I noticed the changes that I made were actually just petty minor UI changes. Admittedly, I was caught up on the fact that my classmates all created high fidelity prototypes in step 1 when I just did the common grayscale one (I even got called out on this lol). Consequently, during this second round of revisions I was more focused on the visual design and branding of my app. Looking back on this entire project, this part was quite fun; however, I definitely realize now that I should have prioritized fixing the UX because there were still so, so many kinks at this stage. </p>
      <p>I address my solution to this problem this in the next section, along with additional steps that I took after the class finished to make the user experience more cohesive.</p>

      <p>After listening to the feedback that I got, set out to fix the problems that were brought up. However, at the end of this round I noticed the changes that I made were pretty minor UI changes.

      <p><em>I have a working prototype of this not-so-great v2 up on Invision if anyone’s interested in checking that out. Please, don’t judge me too harshly on this “learning experience” though. I know it's not that great...</em></p>
      <p>Very recently and about a few months after the class finished, I took another look at my app and did an overhaul on some parts of the UX where things got a bit confusing. </p><br>

    <h3>A Third Iteration</h3>
      <h4>A more interactive and simplified onboarding experience</h4>
      <p>Previously, the onboarding process was comprised of static screens detailing the app’s features. I discovered during user testing that due to the novelty of the app, a lot of users became overwhelmed by information and everything that could be done that people couldn’t really understand what this app could do really do for them or how it could fit into their lives. To address this, I decided to make the onboarding process more interactive for the user. This also reduces the chance of the user facing a blank ingredient Home screen and having to figure out how to add ingredients then.</p>

          <h4>A more cohesive filtering process</h4>
          <p>Previously, the Home screen was the user’s Ingredient List, where the user could see what ingredients they inputted into the app and also add or remove ingredients. I decided that with the new onboarding process, it would make the most sense all around to make the Recipes the homepage as it’s where the most exploration can happen for the user. </p>
          <p>I also decided to redesign and simplify the card design to make browsing easier for the user. I implemented a “match” percentage so users could see how many of the ingredients they have matches the recipe’s ingredients. The results are so sorted by match percentage. I also included a star rating so users could tell how great or ungreat a recipe is and not have to spend time clicking through each recipe to see the rating. </p>
