    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.washingtonplacefoundation.org/" target="_blank" title="Washington Place">Washington Place is a historic museum</a> in the middle of downtown Honolulu. The building—a Greek-revival style two-story mansion built in 1841—is known for being the private residence of Queen Lili`uokalani, the last reigning monarch of the Hawaiian kingdom. Since the Queen’s passing in the mansion, Washington Place has since been the official residence of all Hawaii governors. Today, Washington Place houses artifacts of the Queen and other well-known officials in Hawaii.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>I started this project in the last week of August 2017 when I was approached by my major and program advisor at the University of Hawaii at West Oahu, Sharla Hanaoka. She was asked by the First Lady of Hawaii, Dawn Ige, to create an application that incorporated digital technology into the Washington Place visitor experience. The app was scheduled to debut in mid-December 2017 to coincide with the museum’s reopening after a year of renovations. Initially, the app planned to feature one of the new exhibits on the first governor of Hawaii, Governor William F. Quinn.</p>
    <p>Before I joined the project, Sharla and the First Lady brainstormed a few potential features for the app, one of which was incorporating Augmented Reality into the user experience. Being quite inexperienced with AR technologies (read: actually no experience at all), and on top of being the sole member of the project with a focus in UX design, I was hesitant about promising any AR incorporation. I told Sharla that I would be open to the possibility of AR when the project had more team members to research AR, but at that point we needed to focus on more feasible features for that relatively short time frame.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <h4>Market Analysis</h4>
    <p>In order to figure out Washington Place’s position in the local museum market, I researched two of the bigger local museums to analyze the type of digital technology already used in Hawaii. The two sites were Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace. While I found that these sites did not have a native mobile app for visitors, they did incorporate some new progressive technologies outside of the “typical” museum experience.</p>

      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p>In addition to the local market, I also researched museums on both national and international scales to understand how other types of technology were incorporated on a broader scale. It’s important for me as a designer to look beyond the typical scope of a project as this helps me to not only understand the market in which my product lives, but also to be inspired by other creative endeavours out there.</p>

        <p>From my research, I discovered that incorporating AR was very, very ambitious and it was a hot new trend that catered to a younger generation. Within museums, AR is able to gamify a visitor’s experience by incorporating interactivity into his/her visit. This interactivity helps to engage families and kids of younger ages who are visiting a museum for a family excursion or a school field trip. This discovery further solidified my then-decision to withhold the AR feature. Washington Place’s target audience was a bell curve of everyone ranging from 7 years to 70 years old, and the museum wasn’t as big in physical size or popularity as other local museums. Instead for this phase, an informational-based app that featured Governor Quinn’s exhibit could suffice the First Lady’s challenge.</p>

        <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
        <p>After my research, I created a user journey map to demonstrate how the app would be used on the day of the reopening ceremony. Here’s "Jennifer", an invited guest to the Washington Place reopening ceremony:</p>

    <!--BEGIN: User Pain Points cont.-->
    <div class="container section">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p>Through this exercise and a few informal interviews with my peers about their app usage patterns, I discovered the potential user pain points to be that:</p>
        <p><strong>Pain Point #1: Users don’t like downloading apps that require them to do or see something—especially when they’re at an on-site location—unless they know for certain the app can benefit them. </strong><br>
        So what is the alternative to downloading an app? How do we get our app into people’s hands at the museum?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the Creative Media department at UHWO has approximately 20 Fifth Generation iPod Touches that were lendable to Washington Place for the reopening ceremony. By bypassing the download hurdle, we could get our app in the hands of our audience much more quickly and easily.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pain Point #2: Since the Quinn exhibit is really a collage of photos on a wall occupying a space of approximately 3 feet by 4 feet, people won’t have much time to view the exhibition, especially on an opening day or a busy day.</strong> <br>
        How do we bridge the in-person experience to the digital experience? How can we encourage visitors to continue what they see in person on the app? </p>
        <p>To get people to transition from the artifact in real life to the exhibit on the app, we asked Washington Place curator, Cynthia Engle, to provide exclusive inside-stories that could be featured in the app. This exclusivity would act to entice visitors to discover more content on the app.</p>
          
        <p><strong>Bonus Pain Point for the Team: </strong>
        On the development side, we did not have a developer devoted to building out the app, so I was essentially volunteering myself to do that job, too. I initially planned to use Invision to build a high fidelity prototype. However, I decided a few months later to attempt building the app in Xcode so it was a bit more presentable. That in itself opened up a whole can of worms that I reflect on later in my Reflection. Throughout the whole production timeline I stressed to Sharla that if this project were to continue in the future, we needed to have a dedicated programmer on our team.</p>

    <!--BEGIN: Visual Design-->
    <div class="container section">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p>As a part of the research process, I discovered that Washington Place did not really have an established brand. Therefore, as a part of my discovery process, I produced assets for the branding of the app, including color scheme and font choices. </p>
        <p>Initially, I chose earthy colors—browns, greens, blues—to represent the museum's nature oasis and to encapsulate its down-to-earth feel in the middle of urban Honolulu. To visualize the museum’s strive for modernity I chose flat values to emulate the flat/material design trend. </p>
        <p>However, after talking with <a href="http://uluulu.hawaii.edu/staff" target="_blank" title="Heather Giugni">Heather Giugni</a>, a Hawaiian archivist who encouraged me to further explore the museum’s personal connection with Queen Lili`uokalani, we shifted to a color palette more representative of Hawaiian royalty to represent the museum’s significance in Hawaiian political history. In Hawaii, rich, saturated golds, reds and purples denote power and aristocracy.</p>
        <p>The color purple was specifically chosen to represent the crown flower, the Queen’s favorite flower. Yellow was chosen to complement purple (as opposed to red, the other color associated with Hawaiian royalty). Sharla also provided an illustrated crown flower pattern to mimic Hawaiian quilts and act as a texture throughout the visual design.</p>
        <p>A combination of serif and sans-serif fonts was used to represent the museum’s established history and the introduction of digital technology, a contrast which represents the duality of old and new.</p>

      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <h4>The Return of AR: Aurasma</h4>
        <p>As I’m well into my research phase, around mid-October I discover that Sharla has been doing some research of her own. She shared with me <a href="https://www.aurasma.com/" target="_blank" title="Aurasma">Aurasma</a>, an AR software from HP (which was recently <a href="https://aurasma.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003496571-Aurasma-is-now-HP-Reveal-" target="_blank" title="Aurasma Is Now HP Reveal!">rebranded as “HP Reveal” on December 18, 2017</a>), and she really wanted us to incorporate its features into the app flow. Well, she absolutely wanted us to incorporate Aurasma into the app flow.</p>
        <p>After researching what Aurasma was, its uses, and subsequently the different ways in which we could incorporate Aurasma into the experience, I decided to design the app as a means to experience Washington Place in two different ways. The first way was a bit more passive via selecting a particular exhibit to explore in the palms of the users’ hands. The second way was based on interactivity and would allow users to scan artifacts with Aurasma to watch them come to life. After this point, the theme of the app shifted more from an informational one to a “choose your experience” theme.</p>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>After the change in scope and additional research, I created some quick wireframes in Adobe XD to layout the Home Screen, the Scanning feature with Aurasma, Quinn’s exhibit (as well as its location within the museum), a general map of the museum and an About section. All of these features (minus the scanning feature) were ubiquitous across all the museum apps that I studied during my market research, and they were features that I thought would help users guide their way through the museum. </p>

    <div class="container section">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p>After also building a prototype in Adobe XD, I did a usability test with 3 users. An issue that one user had was with the Exhibition design on the Home Screen. In that version, there was only a single exhibition laid out in a rough card form, and the user did not know that it was clickable. To address this, I played around with the idea of using a prominent CTA button, and eventually I ended up adding another card for the Queen’s artifacts exhibition, which populated the Home Screen. After this test, I realized that this particular screen did indeed look fairly empty and unmemorable. </p>
        <p>Further wireframes were created in Sketch after I told Sharla I wanted to explore the program because I have never used it before. Subsequent prototypes were made in Invision and incorporated video and media sections as suggested by Sharla. </p>

<div class="container section">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <h4>High-fidelity Prototype</h4>
    <p>Due to my lack proficiency in object-oriented programming (and lack of appropriate developer on the team in phase 1), a few features from the wireframes had to be withheld from the Xcode build. These features included, the proposed maps, an exhibit’s “Find on Map” feature, and audio/video features capabilities. The Scan tab’s functionality also had to be reduced in the build. To actually use the scanning feature with Aurasma, users needed to close the Washington Place app, return to the iOS home screen, and open the Aurasma app. This change was due to the fact that we couldn’t install the Aurasma SDK into the app itself. We made sure, however, to make it clear to users via instructions and in-person walkthroughs how to use the two apps in conjunction with each other.</p>
    <p>With Aurasma’s AR scanning feature, users scan an artifact or a picture of it and a short audio or video clip pops up describing the artifact, its history and its significance. </p>
    <p>Below is a video of the Xcode prototype demonstrating the beginning of Quinn’s gallery and ending with a view of the About screen.</p>

    <h4>The Debut</h4>
    <p>We debuted the app to First Lady of Hawaii, Dawn Ige, and Washington Place curator, Cynthia Engle, two days before the reopening of Washington Place (which was on December, 14, 2017). We explained to them how to use the app and the Aurasma feature limitation. To my surprise, they ending up loving it. They loved the idea behind the app and how we surpassed expectations by including the AR feature into the experience. They thought it was a great starting point for a product for which they saw could be used at the museum.</p>

    <p class="caption">Debuting the high-fidelity prototype to First Lady of Hawaii Dawn Ige (in red). </p>
    <p>On the day of the reopening ceremony we stationed around the museum five of the iPods with the apps preloaded on them via TestFlight. Sharla and I were mostly upstairs to demo the scanning feature at the Quinn exhibit and to talk about the app with guests.</p>
  </div>

<!--END: Outcome-->
    
<!--BEGIN: Reflection-->
<div class="container section">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I have to be honest, all throughout the process I was skeptical about finishing the app by the deadline. About a couple weeks in, Sharla thought we would have about a month’s extension, however, a few weeks later we discovered that the December date was actually going to happen. It was also a bit challenging not being able to communicate directly with the client and not getting as much feedback as I hoped. There were also WiFi connectivity issues at the museum that affected the performance of Aurasma, which was likely due to our lack of site visits and challenging communication situation. </p>
    <p>On the development side, we didn’t have a developer to chime in throughout the process. It would have been <em>extremely</em> helpful to have worked with someone who had a dedicated programming background so that the feasibility of my designs could be corroborated by someone with a tech-mindset. I would like to stress that the lack of a developer on the team and frankly the small team size weren’t deliberate choices. These were due to not being able to find any candidates at the school in the short amount of time that we had. Fortunately for me, I was at the right place at the right time, and I came into the project with a determined mindset to complete the project by the reopening ceremony. </p>
    <p>Building out a prototype in Xcode was also a bit tricky. We had interactive features designed in the UX (for example, audio/video) which weren’t possible to include in Adobe XD and Invision. Additionally, since we were only deploying the app on about five of our iPods, I said building it would be possible. It was really time-consuming and required a lot of extra work on my part. However, in retrospect, I can’t say I regret doing this as it concluded into a massive learning experience. Building the high fidelity prototype in Xcode taught me a number of things:</p>
      
    <p>&bull; It taught me what Xcode was and what its GUI looks like<br>
    &bull; I learned a bit of iOS development<br>
    &bull; As a designer, I can better can empathize with developers, especially iOS developers<br>
    &bull; I researched extensively how to upload apps to the App Store and beta testing via TestFlight<br>
    &bull; Why is saving out app icons such a pain?</p>
    <p>I know the prototype isn’t perfect and the UX right now is a bit precarious, but I think the product that I designed is a very good starting place as our MVP.</p>
    <p>Phase 2 of the Washington Place app is currently ongoing, and we hope to incorporate a better experience with Aurasma/HP Reveal and to include additional historically-rich content that is housed in the museum. Also, we have a student programmer on the team now! </p>
