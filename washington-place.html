    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.washingtonplacefoundation.org/" target="_blank" title="Washington Place">Washington Place is a historic museum</a> in the middle of downtown Honolulu. The property is known for once being the private residence of Queen Lili`uokalani, the last reigning monarch of the Hawaiian kingdom. Since the Queen’s passing, the property has been used as the official residence of Hawaii governors and is also now a museum that houses Hawaiian artifacts.<br></p><br>

    <!--BEGIN: CHALLENGE -->
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>Our task was to develop for the First Lady of Hawaii, Dawn Ige, a product for the museum to encourage visits and engage visitors in an interesting way with technology. The app was to debut during the reopening ceremony of the museum and feature an exhibit about past Hawaii Governors who lived in the home. </p>

    <!--END: Group photo-->
    <p>Before I joined the project, my Project Manager pitched the idea of implementing Augmented Reality into the museum experience. A bit hesitant about working with a technology I've never touched before, I told my PM I would research into AR's use cases and practicality for our situation, but it was important to focus on more feasible features for the short time frame we were given, approximately 3 months.</p><br>
  
    
    <!--BEGIN: RESEARCH -->
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <h4>Market Analysis</h4>
    <p>In order to figure out Washington Place’s position in the local museum market, I researched two of the bigger local museums to analyze the type of digital technology being used in Hawaii and to understand users' current trends and expectations. These two sites were the Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace.</p><br>
  </div>

    </div>
    <!--BEGIN: RESEARCH cont. -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p><strong>Finding #1: While I found that these local museums did not have native apps, they did incorporate technologies outside of the “typical” museum experience. Therefore, I concluded Hawaii users would be receptive to an app in a museum setting.</strong></p>
        <p>In addition to the local market, I also researched museums on both national and international scales to widen my scope and think outside of the box.</p><br>

    </div>
    <!--BEGIN: RESEARCH cont.-->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p><strong>Finding #2: These museums that incorporated AR were established institutions that had massive funding to support these endeavors. AR was also a hot new trend that catered to a younger generation, a subset that encompassed less than half of Washington Place's audience. </strong></p>
        <p>Because of these findings, I advocated to stray on the "simpler" side and to create an informational-based mobile app that featured the Governor exhibit in galleries. </p><br>

    <!--BEGIN: User Journey Map-->
        <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
        <p>After my market research, I created a user journey map to demonstrate how the app would be used on the day of the reopening ceremony to find areas where an app could mitigate a visitor's pain points. Here’s "Jennifer":</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!--BEGIN: User Persona photo-->
    <div class="container section">
      <div class="case-photo col-12 col-lg-11 offset-lg-5"><img src="images/washington-place/wp-user-journey-map.jpg" alt="Washington Place - Journey Map">
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!--BEGIN: User Pain Points cont.-->
    <div class="container section">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p>Through this exercise, along with informal peer interviews about app usage patterns, I discovered our potential user pain points to be that:</p>
        <p><strong>Pain Point #1: Users don’t like downloading apps that require them to do or see something unless they know for certain the app can benefit them. </strong><br>
        So what is the alternative to downloading an app?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, we had iPod Touches that we could lend to the museum with the app preloaded. By bypassing the download hurdle, we could get our app in the hands of our audience much more quickly and easily.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pain Point #2: Since the Governor exhibit is a collage of photos on a wall, people won’t have much time to view the exhibit, especially on an opening day or a busy day. </strong> <br>
        How do we bridge the in-person experience to the digital experience? How can we encourage visitors to continue what they see in person on the app?</p>
        <p>To get people to transition from the artifact in real life to the exhibit on the app, we needed exclusive inside-stories that could be featured in the app. This exclusivity would act to entice visitors to discover more content within the app.</p><br>

    <!--BEGIN: Visual Design-->
        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p>As a part of the research process, I discovered that Washington Place did not have a brand or a visual identity. Thus, I spent two weeks designing a new visual language for our app experience. </p>
        <p>Initially, I chose earthy colors—browns, greens, blues—to encapsulate the museum's down-to-earth setting in the middle of urban Honolulu. To visualize the museum’s strive for modernity I chose flat values to emulate Material Design patterns.</p>
        <p>However, after speaking with Heather Giugni, a Hawaiian archivist who encouraged me to further research the museum’s personal connection with Queen Lili`uokalani, we shifted to a color palette more representative of Hawaiian royalty to represent the museum’s significance in Hawaiian political history. In Hawaii, rich golds, reds, and purples denote power and aristocracy. The color purple was chosen specifically to represent the crown flower, the Queen’s favorite flower. The PM also provided an illustrated crown flower pattern to mimic Hawaiian quilts and act as texture throughout the app.</p>
        <p>A combination of serif and sans-serif fonts was used to represent the museum’s established history and the introduction of technology, a contrast which represents the duality of old and new.</p>
      </div>

    <!--BEGIN: Aurasma-->
    <div class="container section">
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 offset-lg-2">
        <p><strong>Important UX Learning Moment: Research beyond market analyses, on-site visits, or user personas is so important to UX design. Being able to have conversations with experts surrounding multiple facets of the project can unearth compelling stories, which can create more impactful and meaningful design decisions.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h4>The Return of AR: Aurasma</h4>
        <p>As I’m well into my research phase, I discover that my PM has been doing research of her own. She shared with me <a href="https://www.aurasma.com/" target="_blank" title="Aurasma">Aurasma</a>, an AR software from HP (which was recently <a href="https://aurasma.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003496571-Aurasma-is-now-HP-Reveal-" target="_blank" title="Aurasma Is Now HP Reveal!">rebranded as “HP Reveal” in December 2017</a>), and she really wanted us to incorporate this into our app. </p>
        <p>After researching Aurasma's use cases and its ease of use, I decided we could use the app to enhance our initial vision for the museum. I revised the app so users could experience Washington Place in two different ways: first, by selecting a particular exhibit to explore media in the palms of users’ hands; and second, by allowing them to scan artifacts with Aurasma to watch them come to life. After this point, the theme of the app shifted more from an informational one to a “choose your experience” theme.</p>
        <p>With Aurasma’s scanning feature, users can scan an artifact or a picture of it, and it will trigger an action. For this experience, we created short 30-second audio snippets that describe the artifact, complete with soothing background Hawaiian music to complete the experience. We also implemented video clips of interviews so users can literally watch artifacts come to life.</p>
          <br>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>After the change in scope and additional research, I created wireframes of the app's unique flows with Adobe XD.</p>

        <br><h3>Usability Testing</h3><br>
        <p>After building a prototype in Adobe XD, I conducted a usability test with 3 users. </p>
        <p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> An issue that one user had involved the Exhibition design on the Home Screen. In the first version, there was only a single exhibition laid out in a card UI, and the user did not know that it was clickable. After getting this feedback, I could see for myself how having one card on a screen was indeed ineffective.</p>
        <p>To address this, I added a prominent CTA button and another card to populate the Home Screen. </p>
        <p>Further iterations were created in Sketch and incorporated video and media sections to include additional engaging content for the user.</p><br>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <h4>High-fidelity Prototype</h4>
    <p>I ended up creating a "higher-fidelity" prototype in Xcode so we could beta test the app at the reopening ceremony with more users. Due to the lack of resources in this early phase, a few features from the wireframes had to be withheld from the Xcode build. </p>
    <p>Below is a video of the Xcode prototype demonstrating the beginning of Quinn’s gallery and ending with a view of the About screen.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>The Debut</h4>
    <p>We debuted the app to First Lady of Hawaii, and the Washington Place curator, Cynthia Engle, two days before the reopening of Washington Place in December 2017. To my surprise, they ending up loving it. They loved the idea behind the app and how we surpassed expectations by including the AR feature into the experience. They thought it was a great starting point for a product for which they saw could be used at the museum.</p>

    <p class="caption">Debuting the high-fidelity prototype to First Lady of Hawaii Dawn Ige (in red). </p>
    <p>On the day of the reopening ceremony, we stationed around the museum five of the iPods with the apps preloaded on them via TestFlight. Sharla and I were mostly upstairs to demo the scanning feature at the Governor exhibit and conduct informal and unobtrusive usability testing with guests.</p>
    <p>To my surprise again, people were really intrigued and amazed by the scanning feature and the general consensus was that they loved the look and feel of the app. However, something interesting was that people did not pick up the iPod themselves. I think there may have been a few explanations for this: the evening's crowd was on the older side (40-55 years old), or maybe the iPods weren't displayed prominently enough.</p><br>
    
    <!--BEGIN: Results-->
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>Months after the reopening ceremony, we received feedback from the First Lady that the younger visitors really enjoy using the scanning feature and they will actually try to scan everything in the museum. This engagement allowed kids to learn about the Washington Place and feel like they are invited to explore the residence and the property's rich history</p>
    <p>Numbers-wise, <strong>weekly visits have increased by 300%</strong>, which exceeds the goal of encouraging people to visit the museum.</p><br>
    
<!--BEGIN: Reflection-->
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Throughout the process, I was skeptical about finishing the app by the deadline. It was also a bit challenging not being able to communicate directly with the client and not getting as much feedback from them as I had hoped. There were also WiFi connectivity issues at the museum that affected the performance of the Aurasma scanning features, which was likely due to our lack of site visits and challenging communication situation.</p>
    <p>On the development side, we didn’t have a developer to chime in throughout the process. It would have been extremely helpful to have worked with someone in this early phase who had a dedicated programming background so that the feasibility of my designs could be corroborated by someone with a tech mindset. I would like to stress that the team was small team due to not being able to find any candidates in the short amount of time that we had. In my case, I like to think that I was at the right place at the right time, and I came into the project with a determined mindset to complete the project within the short timeline.</p>
    <p>Getting to build a prototype in Xcode and launch it with TestFlight was pretty interesting as well. I felt that it was possible to do this at the time and I wanted the opportunity to learn a bit of Xcode. I learned a lot about iOS development, which can definitely help me better communicate and empathize with developers in the future, especially on a mobile team. However, I really learned that there's no substitute for a good developer. </p>
    <p>Phase 2 of the Washington Place app is currently ongoing, and we hope to include additional historically-rich content that is housed in the museum. Also, we have a student programmer on the team now!</p>
